Java Regex 2 - Duplicate Words

When we write something, it is easy to repeat words by mistake. For example: Monmoy loves to to code. Here, "to" 
is written multiple times.

Using Regex, we can easily identify the repeated pattern in a given text. In this problem, you will be given a text. 
Your task is to identify the consecutively repeated words and delete them after the first occurrence of the word.

Complete the code in the editor to solve this problem. Don't modify any extra lines. You will get the wrong answer 
if you modify more than 3 lines.

To restore the original code in the editor, create a new buffer by clicking on the top-left button in the editor.

Input Format

The first line of input contains an integer N, representing the number of testcases. The next N lines contain a 
string of English letters and whitespaces.

Constraints

In each line, there will be at most 104 English letters and whitespaces.

1≤N≤100
Output Format

Print the input string after deleting the consecutive words after the first occurrence of the word.

Sample Input
